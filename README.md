### Skate it. Rate it. Pass it to the left. 

Ever found yourself in a new city with some time to spare but no way to find good local spots? SpotFinder will allow you to search for, post, rate, and review your favorite (or not so favorite) skate spots worldwide. 

Using Mongoose for database storage and Express for all routing this web based CRUD app is simple under the hood and very user friendly. All styles are 100% vanilla CSS.
